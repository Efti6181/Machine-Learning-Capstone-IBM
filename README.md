# IBM Machine Learning Capstone

Welcome to the IBM Machine Learning Capstone repository. This repository houses comprehensive materials for the Machine Learning Capstone course, a pivotal component of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate program.

## About this Course

The Machine Learning Capstone course is designed to be the crowning achievement of your machine learning educational journey. It provides an opportunity to apply and showcase your expertise in machine learning using a variety of Python-based libraries, including Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras. This course is intended for those who have successfully completed all prior courses in the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate program.

### Course Objectives

Throughout this capstone project, participants will engage in the following activities:

- **Develop a Course Recommender System**: Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to build a system that recommends courses to users based on their preferences and behaviors.
- **Analyze Course-Related Datasets**: Perform in-depth analysis of datasets related to courses, extracting meaningful insights and patterns.
- **Calculate Cosine Similarity and Create a Similarity Matrix**: Implement mathematical techniques to measure similarity between courses, forming the basis for recommendation algorithms.
- **Generate Recommendation Systems**: Employ various methodologies such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for collaborative filtering.

Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to present their work to peers for evaluation, promoting a collaborative and interactive learning environment.
